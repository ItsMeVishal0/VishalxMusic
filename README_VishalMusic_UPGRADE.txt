Upgraded by script:
- Replaced name 'Shruti' -> 'Vishal' across filenames and file contents where safe.
- Replaced 'Shrutimusic' -> 'VishalMusic'.
- Replaced occurrences of 'Free' -> 'Premium' in text content.
- Added 'premium' class to HTML elements with class 'btn' or btn-* patterns where detected.
Notes:
- Binary files were copied without modification.
- Some framework-specific or compiled files might need manual adjustments.
- Test the app locally and run any build steps required by the project.
